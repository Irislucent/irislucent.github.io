Hello there - welcome to my personal webpage!

My name is Yuxuan Wu.  
I'm a first-year PhD student in [Music X Lab](http://www.musicxlab.com/#/) at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, supervised by Professor Gus Xia and Professor Bhiksha Raj.  
Before I entered MBZUAI, I completed my Master's degree in Music and Technology at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Professor Roger Dannenberg. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering, where I conducted research on speech synthesis with Professor Jie Zhu.  
My research interest lies in the field of music AI, including AI music generation, music information retrieval and music representation learning, hoping to not only promote applications of AI in music appreciation and creation, but also broaden the horizon of AI by and for humanity. I also have experience in the industrial side of computer music, having had two internships in ByteDance AI Lab and TikTok, respectively.

<!-- Currently I'm working on analysing and predicting the composing techniques of pop piano accompaniment, hoping that it can help improve modelling the underlying structures in polyphonic music. -->

As a musician, I compose and produce various types of music. I started playing the piano at 7, and started writing songs at 13. Over the years I published some of my works in the name of [*BowOfAtlas*](./music/#bowofatlas).

I'm an senior student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Information Engineering, and also a musician. Deeply interested in music technology research and musichology, I'm planning to pursue a postgrad degree in a related field. My graduation project focuses on the smoothing technology when joining TTS and recorded vocals, under the guidance of Prof. Jie Zhu. Since July 2019 I've been a research intern of the MIR Lab of Fudan University led by Prof. Wei Li, where I completed a project about vocal register recognition. Currently I'm a intern of AI Lab, Bytedance at Shanghai focusing on music research and production.

If you're interested, you can view some of my music works in the name of BowOfAtlas on Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/cn/artist/bowofatlas/1474860092 or Netease Music: https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=1131005. I'm also happy to show some other works such as unpublished ones in personal contact.

By the way I'm proud to stand as a MtF. As I got some vital help and care from those in China when I was frustrated and confused the most, I pay attention to and am willing to attend LGBTQ+ nonprofit organizations because millions of brothers and sisters are still there in need, and that we should stand together to make the world a more diverse and colorful place.
