Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Yuxuan Wu.

I'm an senior student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Information Engineering, and also a musician. Deeply interested in music technology research and musichology, I'm planning to pursue a postgrad degree in a related field. My graduation project focuses on the smoothing technology when joining TTS and recorded vocals, under the guidance of Prof. Jie Zhu. Since July 2019 I've been a research intern of the MIR Lab of Fudan University led by Prof. Wei Li, where I completed a project about vocal register recognition. Currently I'm a intern of AI Lab, Bytedance at Shanghai focusing on music research and production.

If you're interested, you can view some of my music works in the name of BowOfAtlas on Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/cn/artist/bowofatlas/1474860092 or Netease Music: https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=1131005. I'm also happy to show some other works such as unpublished ones in personal contact.

By the way I'm proud to stand as a MtF. As I got some vital help and care from those in China when I was frustrated and confused the most, I pay attention to and am willing to attend LGBTQ+ nonprofit organizations because millions of brothers and sisters are still there in need, and that we should stand together to make the world a more diverse and colorful place.
